Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.</p>",

              "description": "<p><em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em> is a game for five to ten players in which you have to draw and conclude. Trying to conclude something while drawing is not as easy as you think!<br /><br />Everyone will try to draw what the game master wrote on the prompt cards, but each player is only allowed to draw one line. For example, if the topic is &quot;cat&quot;, you could draw an ear or a whisker so that the other players know you know the topic. There is one fake artist among the players - someone who doesn't know the topic and will have to draw a line randomly.<br /><br />After each player has drawn twice, they will have to decide who the fake artist is. If the fake artist receives the most votes, that player loses. Otherwise, the fake artist and the game master win the game. Now, you might think it is extremely easy to find out who the fake artist is, but there is one more rule: Even if the fake artist receives the most votes, that player can still guess the topic of the picture everyone drew - and win with a correct guess!<br /><br />Knowing this rule, it becomes much more difficult for the real artists to draw their lines. You want to show the other artists that you know the topic of the picture, but you don't want to be too obvious in front of the fake artist - so the picture becomes a crazy mess!<br /><br /><strong>Contents:</strong><br />9 Title Cards<br />10 Color Pens<br />White Board Marker<br />Drawing Paper<br />Manual</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.</p>",
